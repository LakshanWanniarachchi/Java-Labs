1) yes.
With the `public` keyword, makes the variable accessible from anywhere. Other classes and packages 
can access the variable directly.
Adding the `static` keyword It can be accessed using the class name, without creating an instance of the 
class. 
The `final` keyword makes the variable a constant, which means its value cannot be changed once 
assigned. It is often used to state constants or unchanging values.

2)No.
An abstract method is a method without a body, and it serves as a placeholder that must be 
implemented in the concrete subclasses or implementing classes.
In Interface, abstract method cannot have a body. And all methods in interface are all abstract methods.

3)
In the IntefaceImplemented class, you can not change the value of X because it is declared as final in the 
interface. The final keyword makes a variable constant, meaning its value can not be modified once 
assigned
